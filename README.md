# PageRank

Applying the basic ideas behind PageRank to a graph, which is what it’s applied to in practice. 

Typically, PageRank is applied using matrices and operations over them. In this assignment, we’re going to take an approach where we imagine there’s a hypothetical web surfer who is visiting web pages, 
who chooses links at random to decide on the next page to visit: this is in fact how it’s characterised by the inventors of the PageRank algorithm
